Version 1.1
Effective Date: January 20, 2026

Copyright © 2026 Sergey Mosin <sergey@srgdev.com>
All rights reserved.

1. PERMITTED USAGE

The r-js framework (hereinafter referred to as "the Software") is provided free of charge for both personal and commercial use.

You are permitted to:

* Use the Software as a dependency in web applications and websites.
* Copy and distribute the Software only as an unmodified dependency bundled with a larger application.
* Deploy applications that include the Software in production environments.

The Software is not open source and is not licensed under any OSI-approved license.

---

2. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS & RESTRICTIONS

The Software, including but not limited to its source code, implementation details, file structure, directive and attribute syntax, runtime behavior, component lifecycle mechanisms, reactivity implementation, and documented APIs, is the proprietary intellectual property of Sergey Mosin.

The following restrictions apply:

2.1 No Derivative Frameworks

You may not use the Software, in whole or in part, to create, distribute, or market any competing or derivative web framework, UI library, or framework-level tooling.

This restriction includes reusing or extracting identifiable portions of the Software’s implementation, directive syntax, runtime behavior, or API structure for the purpose of building similar framework-level systems.

---

2.2 Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning Training and Inference

You may not use the Software itself, including its source code, internal implementation details, runtime behavior, compiled artifacts, or non-public materials, as training data, fine-tuning data, or evaluation datasets for any artificial intelligence or machine learning system where the intent or effect is to reproduce, derive, or generate framework-level functionality similar to r-js.

Training and Fine-Tuning Restrictions

For the avoidance of doubt, training, fine-tuning, retraining, or model distillation using any part of the Software other than publicly provided documentation and examples is strictly prohibited, whether such use is direct, indirect, automated, or performed at scale.

Permitted AI and IDE Inference Use

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the use of publicly provided documentation and example code only is explicitly permitted for inference-time usage by artificial intelligence systems and IDE-integrated assistants, including but not limited to:

* Code completion and suggestions
* Documentation search and summarization
* Interactive developer assistance
* Static analysis and linting support

provided that:

* Such systems do not ingest, learn from, or retain any portion of the Software’s source code or internal behavior beyond the permitted documentation and examples; and
* The output does not reconstruct, approximate, or expose the Software’s proprietary implementation, internal APIs, or framework-level mechanisms.

No Derivative Output

AI-generated output must not be used to create, train, or distribute competing or derivative frameworks, libraries, or framework-level tooling derived from r-js.

---

2.3 Modification and Redistribution

* Modification of the Software is permitted for internal use only.
* Redistribution of modified versions of the Software is strictly prohibited without prior written permission from the copyright holder.
* Extraction of framework-specific functionality to build standalone tools or libraries is prohibited.

---

2.4 Future Versions

All restrictions and terms in this Agreement apply to the current version of the Software and to all future versions, updates, and features released under the r-js name.

---

3. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:

* WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
* FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
* NON-INFRINGEMENT

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

---

3.1 Severability

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be illegal, invalid, or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be severed from this Agreement to the extent necessary to make the remainder valid and enforceable. The remaining provisions shall continue in full force and effect and shall not be affected thereby.

---

4. GOVERNING LAW

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.
